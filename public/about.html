            I am a Computer Science of University of Nigeria <br>
            Passionate about IT and solving real world problems, and also making money doing it(grins) <br>
            I am currently learning backend development with Node at the Zuri I4G internship <br>
            That's why this website is kinda shitty, you'll have to pardon me, I'm not a frontend developer nor <br>
            interested in it
